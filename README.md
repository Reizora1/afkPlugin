# Minecraft AFK Plugin
- This plugin is the isolated implementation of an AFK logic present in myPlugin project (That shithole is my experimental lab. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED).
- It only has the afk logic feature and its associated commands; getafktimer, setafktimer, & setspawn.
- This is a WiP Project and will receive more features related to AFK logic and optimization on large scale playerbase.
